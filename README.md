# Nostr Decentralized Trust System (NIP-101)

This project is about creating a decentralized trust system for the Nostr protocol.
It is a strfry server that combinates with UPlanet, Astroport.ONE & UPassport

## Overview

Web3 is about owning and signing data.
NIP-101 introduce a strfry plugin that is monitoring NOSTR message being recorded on the relay

If a message is marked by application=UPlanet* and get latitude & longitude fields,
then message is transmitted to local UMAP IA for it to answer and follow player.

This behaviour allows post-treatment made by SECTOR and REGION keys to read and analyse what happens on UPlanet

## Known Issues and Limitations

*   The UI is basic and could be enhanced.
*   The application currently handles only text notes.
